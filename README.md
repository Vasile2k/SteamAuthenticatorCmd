# SteamAuthenticatorCmd
Steam authenticator that can be used from command line

## Usage
To use it simply add a `maFiles` folder with your accounts in the same directory with the application and run it like `SteamAuthenticatorCmd.exe -getAuthCode -account yourSteamIdHere`. Very useful if you have bots and you want to do some bad things.
